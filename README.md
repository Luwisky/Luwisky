#👋 Hello, I’m Monica Enyam Nkiri**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’m a Data Analyst and Data Scientist with a background in Computer Engineering, focused on using data to extract insights, build predictive models, and support data-driven decision-making.

My work is project-driven and practical, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical reasoning, SQL-based analysis, and supervised machine learning. I enjoy working with real datasets to solve problems related to pricing, income prediction, healthcare risk, and business performance.

## why i stand out
### Portfolio-Driven, Hands-On Learning

Unlike many beginners who only follow tutorials, you build real projects that simulate real business and healthcare problems: salary prediction, retail sales analysis, prostate cancer data, and wine quality prediction.

Each project shows your ability to go end-to-end: cleaning → exploration → modeling → insights.

### Technical Versatility

You can work with Python, R, and SQL/PostgreSQL, covering both coding and database querying.

You have machine learning experience (regression, classification) and statistical reasoning (hypothesis testing, A/B testing), which makes your work data-driven and actionable.

### Business & Client Awareness

You translate data into insights that matter—not just models. For example:

Retail sales → trends and seasonality

Salary prediction → compensation insights

You approach problems with a client-oriented mindset, which is rare for entry-level talent.

### Clean Documentation & Remote-Readiness

You write clear, reproducible, and professional code.

You document assumptions, steps, and insights, making your projects easy to follow for clients or collaborators.

This is a key differentiator for remote roles or freelance work.

### Soft Skills That Complement Your Tech

Strong problem-solving and analytical thinking

Clear communication (explaining technical concepts simply)

Self-learning and adaptability—you grow with every project

Collaboration readiness—essential for freelance or team projects

### Growth Mindset

You actively update your portfolio, learn new tools, and improve project quality.

You treat every dataset as a learning opportunity, turning mistakes into polished outcomes.
