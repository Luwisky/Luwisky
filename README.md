**👋 Hello, I’m Monica Enyam Nkiri**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I’m a Data Analyst and Data Scientist with a background in Computer Engineering, focused on using data to extract insights, build predictive models, and support data-driven decision-making.

My work is project-driven and practical, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical reasoning, SQL-based analysis, and supervised machine learning. I enjoy working with real datasets to solve problems related to pricing, income prediction, healthcare risk, and business performance.
